# Simple React Calculator

A functional web application built with React that performs basic arithmetic operations using user inputs. The calculator leverages React Hooks, specifically the `useState` hook, to manage input fields and results.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator that:
- Accepts two inputs from the user.
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Validates user inputs and displays appropriate messages.

## Features

1. **Input Fields**:
   - Two text input fields for entering numbers (supports integers and floating-point numbers).

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Four buttons for basic operations:
     - Addition
     - Subtraction
     - Multiplication
     - Division

3. **Validation**:
   - Validates inputs to ensure they are not empty and are either integers or floating-point numbers.
   - Displays an error message in red if validation fails.

4. **Results**:
   - Displays the result of the arithmetic operation in green when the operation is successful.
